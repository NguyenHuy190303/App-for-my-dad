Speaker A: Welcome to another Deep Dive. We're tackling your money or your life today.

Speaker B: Oh, a good one. It's a classic, right? And it really gets you thinking differently about money.

Speaker A: It's not just about getting rich or anything. It's more about using money to live a better life, actually. And feeling good about your finances.

Speaker B: Totally, feeling calm.

Speaker A: Exactly, yeah, calm. So we'll be looking at excerpts from the book. It's by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez. And yeah, obviously, we can't cover every single thing from their program. But we're going to focus on that core idea, the shift in thinking that the book promotes.

Speaker B: I think that's the most important part, really.

Speaker A: I agree. It's not about these quick tricks to get rich, or you have to be miserable to save money. It's about understanding your relationship with money and how it affects your time, your energy, your everything, really.

Speaker B: Absolutely, yeah.

Speaker A: OK, so the book talked about this idea of money as life energy. Can you explain what that means?

Speaker B: OK, so it means thinking about the time and effort that you put into actually earning money. So imagine you work for eight hours and you earn $100. So when you go out and you spend that $100, you're actually spending those eight hours of your life.

Speaker A: Whoa, I never thought of it that way. That's a really powerful way to look at it.

Speaker B: It is. It makes you really think twice.

Speaker A: Definitely, before you buy something.

Speaker B: Right, like, is this worth the hours that I worked?

Speaker A: Exactly. So it really shifts your perspective. It's not just about the dollar amount. It's about how you are using your time.

Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, and there's a story in the book, I think it's really good, about this couple, Jason and Nedra.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I remember them. And they had kind of different views on money.

Speaker B: Jason was more careful with spending, whereas Nedra would maybe overspend sometimes, get into debt. And it's a good example of how people can have totally opposite money personalities, which obviously can lead to issues.

Speaker A: But what's interesting is, through this concept of money as life energy, they were able to kind of see things from each other's perspective.

Speaker B: Exactly, understanding. Yeah, like get on the same page. So it's not about one person being right or wrong about money. It's more about understanding each other's habits and finding a way to approach spending that works for both of you.

Speaker A: Totally. OK, so then the book introduces this idea of the fulfillment curve.

Speaker B: OK. You've heard of this?

Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So this is a graph that basically shows how spending and happiness are connected, like how they're related to each other.

Speaker B: It's a very interesting visual representation.

Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And it shows that as you spend more, you do get happier at first.

Speaker B: OK, so that makes sense, right? Like, obviously, to a certain point, you know, buying things, getting things, like, brings you joy.

Speaker A: But there's this point of enough where more spending actually doesn't make you happier.

Speaker B: Sometimes it can even make you less happy.

Speaker A: Right, so there's like a peak.

Speaker B: Yes. There's like this point where it's like, OK, more doesn't equal more happiness.

Speaker A: Exactly. It's like, you know, like eating.

Speaker B: Yeah. The first few bites are great.

Speaker A: The first few bites are delicious. But then if you just keep eating and eating and eating, you just feel sick.

Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, it makes sense. So then how do we find that, like, enough point?

Speaker A: It's a great question. And it's very personal.

Speaker B: Of course, yeah. But the book suggests, like, thinking about a time when you felt content, when you felt happy with what you had, what was important to you then, and how can you feel that way again?

Speaker A: Right, right. And it's not about, you know, denying yourself nice things.

Speaker B: Oh, yeah. But it's about being intentional with your spending and focusing on what truly matters to you.

Speaker A: Okay, so instead of always, like, wanting more and more and more...

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: ...we should kind of focus on being, like, happy and content with what we have.

Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. So then, that kind of leads to the book's idea of the pleasures of frugality.

Speaker A: Yes. Which, at first, sounds like a contradiction.

Speaker B: It does. Because when people think of frugality, they think of, like, being cheap.

Speaker A: Deprivation.

Speaker B: Deprivation, yeah.

Speaker A: Right. But the book kind of presents it in a different way. And the word itself is interesting. Like, the word frugal actually comes from words that mean good and enjoyable.

Speaker B: Really?

Speaker A: Yeah. I didn't know that. It's about being wise with your resources and getting the most out of everything.

Speaker B: Oh, okay. So, it's not about, you know, just being cheap for the sake of being cheap.

Speaker A: Right. It's about, like, really appreciating...

Speaker B: Mm-hmm.

Speaker A: ...and using things well.

Speaker B: Yeah, it reminds me of, like, the Spanish word, aprovechar.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Which kind of means, like, to really appreciate something...

Speaker B: Mm-hmm.

Speaker A: ...and use it well. Like, to get the most out of it, whether it's a meal or, like, a beautiful day...

Speaker B: Mm-hmm.

Speaker A: ...or even old clothes.

Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, totally. It's not about, like, denying yourself. It's about being, like, resourceful and creative.

Speaker A: Exactly. And the book gives examples of, like, home-swapping for vacations.

Speaker B: Oh, cool. So, you can travel to new places, but you don't have to spend, like, a ton of money on hotels.

Speaker A: That's such a good example.

Speaker B: Yeah, so it shows how, like, being frugal can actually be fun and adventurous.

Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So, so far, what we've learned from Your Money or Your Life is, like, that encouragement to really see money as our life energy...

Speaker B: Mm-hmm.

Speaker A: ...and to spend it on things that truly matter to us.

Speaker B: Right. And also, like, this challenge to find enjoyment and, like, frugality.

Speaker A: Right. But how do we actually, like, put these ideas into practice?

Speaker B: That's the, that's the big question, right?

Speaker A: Yeah. Like, how do we take this and make it actionable?

Speaker B: Totally, yeah. So, that's where the book's nine-step program comes in. And this gives you, like, a practical roadmap for actually, like, transforming your relationship with money.

Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah, so, can you tell us more about this nine-step program?

Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So, like, the first step is actually tracking your spending.

Speaker A: Okay.

Speaker B: Which might sound a little boring, but it's super important to understand where your money's going.

Speaker A: Yeah, it's like taking a good look at your financial life, right?

Speaker B: Exactly. Not to, like, judge yourself or anything.

Speaker A: No, no.

Speaker B: But just to really understand where your money's going.

Speaker A: Exactly, just awareness.

Speaker B: Yeah. And then, when you see, like, your income and your expenses clearly, you can start connecting your spending to your values.

Speaker A: Okay.

Speaker B: So, you can ask yourself, am I spending on things that I truly enjoy?

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker B: That are important to me? Or am I just spending mindlessly? And that kind of leads into, like, the next step, right?

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: Which is asking yourself these, like, three questions before you buy anything.

Speaker A: I love these questions.

Speaker B: Yeah. And the first one is, did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction, and value in proportion to the life energy the money spent?

Speaker A: Right. So, it's making you really think about, like, is this worth the time that I worked for?

Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Such a powerful question.

Speaker A: Powerful question.

Speaker B: And then the second question is, is this purchase in line with my values and life purpose?

Speaker A: Oh, yeah.

Speaker B: So, it's kind of like thinking about, like, your bigger goals.

Speaker A: Your big picture, yeah.

Speaker B: Yeah, like, are you buying things that are helping you reach those goals?

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker B: Or are they kind of holding you back?

Speaker A: Yeah. And then the third question is, how might this purchase affect the planet?

Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Which is really bringing in, like, that environmental aspect.

Speaker A: Right. Considering the bigger impact.

Speaker B: Yeah. And these questions, they might seem simple.

Speaker A: They do.

Speaker B: But they can really change, like, how you spend...

Speaker A: Dramatically.

Speaker B: Dramatically.

Speaker A: Yeah. Because you start to see that it's not just about, like, what you buy.

Speaker B: Mm-hmm.

Speaker A: But it's about, like, say about your values and your choices.

Speaker B: Yes, their priorities.

Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And then as you kind of, like, think more carefully about your spending, you might start to discover these things called gazingus pins in your life.

Speaker B: Gazingus pins?

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: What are those?

Speaker A: Have you heard of these?

Speaker B: I have.

Speaker A: Okay, good. I'm curious to hear what you say.

Speaker B: Okay, so basically, these are things that you buy that don't really make you happy.

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker B: Or fit with your values.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: So they're like an impulse buy that you regret.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah, guilty.

Speaker B: Or a subscription that you never use.

Speaker A: Oh, totally.

Speaker B: Or like a gadget that's just gathering dust.

Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So they're kind of like those things that we buy without thinking that just, like, clutter our lives and empty our wallets, but they don't really add any value.

Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, so to find your gazingus pins, the book suggests creating a wall chart.

Speaker A: Oh, the wall chart.

Speaker B: Which is basically like a visual way to track your finances. So you put your income, your expenses, on this chart.

Speaker A: Okay.

Speaker B: And you kind of, like, look for patterns over time. So by tracking your spending and asking yourself those three questions, those gazingus pins become really obvious.

Speaker A: You start to see them.

Speaker B: Yeah. You're like, oh, I'm spending all this money on this thing, and it's not really giving me anything back.

Speaker A: Exactly. You see where your money is going, and you can make, like, conscious choices about whether, like, those purchases were actually worth it.

Speaker B: Right. And as you start to remove those gazingus pins, you probably spend less overall.

Speaker A: Right. Yeah, and I think one of the best things about Your Money or Your Life is that it's not about, like, you know, forcing yourself to live on this strict budget or anything.

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker A: It's about making choices that actually make you happy.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: And that are in line with your values. So it's about finding that balance, right?

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: Between enjoying life but also, like, being responsible with your money.

Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. Like, the book's perspective on frugality.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah.

Speaker B: And how it can actually, like, enhance our lives.

Speaker A: Yeah. Definitely. Sounds like it's not really what we usually think of, you know?

Speaker B: Right. The key is understanding that frugality isn't about deprivation.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: It's about resourcefulness and creativity.

Speaker A: Right. Okay, cool.

Speaker B: Yeah. So we'll dive into that a little bit more.

Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I'm excited.

Speaker B: Okay, so we talked about, like, those gazingus pins.

Speaker A: Mm-hmm.

Speaker B: Those things we buy that don't really, like, add any value to our lives.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: And we've started to maybe cut back on, like, unnecessary spending.

Speaker A: Right. But what do we do with the money that we save?

Speaker B: Well, that's where the idea of, like, investing and building financial independence comes in.

Speaker A: Okay, yeah. This is where, like, things start to get really exciting.

Speaker B: Yeah. Like, not having to work for money. That's a goal for a lot of people.

Speaker A: Totally. But how do we actually, like, get there?

Speaker B: So Your Money or Your Life talks about investing your savings in things that are low risk but income-producing assets. So think of, you know, U.S. Treasury bonds, things like that.

Speaker A: Okay, so it's not just about, like, saving money under your mattress.

Speaker B: No. It's about, like, making that money work for you.

Speaker A: Exactly. It's about building that nest egg that grows over time.

Speaker B: Okay. And eventually provides you with enough income that covers your living expenses.

Speaker A: And that's, like, the crossover point, right?

Speaker B: Yes. The book talks about that.

Speaker A: Yes. What exactly does that mean?

Speaker B: So the crossover point is basically, like, that magical moment when the income from your investments equals or exceeds your monthly expenses.

Speaker A: Oh, wow.

Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, at that point, you are financially independent.

Speaker A: You are. You don't need to work for money anymore.

Speaker B: Exactly. That's like true freedom.

Speaker A: Yeah. It's financial freedom.

Speaker B: Okay. So, I mean, I imagine, like, reaching the crossover point.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: It can. A lot of discipline. What about, like, those of us who are, like, just starting out on this journey? Does the book offer any guidance for that?

Speaker A: It does. It has a lot of really great insights for, like, every stage of the journey. And one of the most helpful things I found is that simply knowing you're working towards financial independence, even if it's, you know, years away, it can change how you feel about work right now.

Speaker B: Oh, that's interesting. How so?

Speaker A: Well, when you have a clear goal in mind and, like, a timeline, work can start to feel, you know, less like this burden and more like, you know, a stepping stone to something bigger and better.

Speaker B: So instead of feeling like you're trapped in a job that you maybe don't love, you can see it as, like, a means to an end.

Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. It's like that saying, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Speaker B: I love that saying.

Speaker A: Right. So the journey of work is basically like a step towards that ultimate goal of, you know, freedom and fulfillment.

Speaker B: Yeah. And even if it takes, like, years to reach the crossover point, like, the principles in the book can help you, like, live a better life right now.

Speaker A: Yes. Totally. It's about those small changes, like aligning your spending with your values, finding joy in those simple things and, you know, using money to really create the life that you want.

Speaker B: That's really the essence of Your Money or Your Life, isn't it?

Speaker A: It is. It really is. It's not just about, like, the money itself. It's like a philosophy of life that encourages you to be, like, more aware of your relationship with money.

Speaker B: Absolutely. To make conscious choices and to find a true fulfillment.

Speaker A: And knowing that you're working towards financial independence, even if it's a long way off, can really shift your mindset right now.

Speaker B: It sounds like the book offers a really hopeful and empowering message.

Speaker A: It does. It's not about, like, feeling deprived or limited.

Speaker B: Right. It's about, like, taking control and using it to, like, create a life that is really aligned with your values.

Speaker A: Absolutely. And it reminds us that, like, true wealth isn't measured by the size of your bank account.

Speaker B: Right. It's about, like, the richness of your experiences and the impact you have on the world.

Speaker A: I love that.

Speaker B: Yeah. I'm curious to learn more about, like, the role of giving back.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah. In Your Money or Your Life philosophy. Does the book, like, address that at all?

Speaker B: It definitely does. So once you reach financial independence, you know, you're not just, like, sitting around doing nothing. You have the time and the resources to really pursue your passions and to contribute to the world in, like, a meaningful way.

Speaker A: So it's not about, like, retiring early and just, like, lounging on a beach somewhere.

Speaker B: Not necessarily. I mean, some people might choose to do that, but others might want to, like, continue working, but in a different capacity. Maybe they'll pursue a passion project or they start their own business.

Speaker A: So it's about, like, having the freedom, right, to work on what you truly care about.

Speaker B: It's about, like, aligning your work with your values and using your time and energy in ways that, like, bring you joy.

Speaker A: That's such a more inspiring way to think about it.

Speaker B: Yeah. And I imagine, like, having that, like, solid financial foundation just opens up, like, all sorts of possibilities.

Speaker A: It does. To, like, pursue your passions and, like you said, like, make a difference in the world.

Speaker B: Absolutely. And Your Money or Your Life really emphasizes that, like, financial independence isn't just about personal gain.

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker B: It's about, like, using your resources and your freedom to actually contribute to something bigger than yourself.

Speaker A: So, it's not just about, like, accumulating wealth.

Speaker B: No. It's about using it for good.

Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. It's about recognizing that true wealth comes not just from what you have, but from what you give back to the world, whether that's, like, supporting causes you believe in, volunteering your time, or just, you know, being more present for your loved ones.

Speaker B: Yeah. Financial independence can really empower you to make, like, a positive impact.

Speaker A: This has been, like, such an eye-opening conversation.

Speaker B: It's a great book. Really challenges you to think differently about money and to consider how you can use it as, like, a tool to create a more fulfilling and purposeful life.

Speaker A: It is. It's not just about budgets and spreadsheets. It's about, like, aligning your finances with your values and using them to really create, like, a life of purpose.

Speaker A: Oh, yeah. That you'd like to leave our listeners with?

Speaker B: I think the most important question to ask yourself is.

Speaker A: Okay.

Speaker B: If you knew you could achieve financial independence and free up your time in, like, a finite period, how would that change how you approach work right now?

Speaker B: It is. Like, would you be more engaged?

Speaker A: More productive? Yeah.

Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But I'm curious. Like, what does life actually look like after you reach that crossover point?

Speaker B: Yeah. Is it just, like, early retirement?

Speaker A: Right. Lounging on a beach?

Speaker B: That's what everyone thinks.

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker B: Yeah. But it's not necessarily like that. It's really about, like, having choices.

Speaker A: Okay. So, yeah, some people might choose to retire early, but others, you know, might want to continue working.

Speaker B: So, it's not just about, like, accumulating wealth.

Speaker A: It's about, like, using it for good.

Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. Recognizing that true wealth comes not just from, like, what you have, but from what you give back.

Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, whether it's, like, supporting causes you believe in, volunteering your time, or even just, like, being more present for your loved ones.
